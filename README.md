## Git
By default, it expects the commits and tags to follow a specific format.

### Tags
Tags are expected to follow the semver convention as `v1.0.0`. It is customizable through the `tagFormat` parameter.

### Commits
Commits are expected to follow the following convention:

* `/(Fix|Close|Resolve) #(\d+)/g `: A commit name that matches this regex will automatically be resolved to the corresponding GitHub issue with the title of the issue as the name of the change.
* `Hotfix - Message`: A commit name that starts with `Hotfix` will get included as `others` with Message as the name of the change.

### Issue labels
By default, only issues that contain the labels `[Bug, Feature]` will be included in the release notes. This is customizable through the `labels` parameter.
